# DodgeBall
A Simple dodge ball game created with unity and unity ML Agents. The player using RL, learns to dodge the ball!

## Requirements
1. Unity
2. Unity ML Agents
3. Tensorflow

## Installation

Follow the installation procedure in unity ML agents. Please make sure that your Python-API and ml-agents versions are the same as they are not backwards compatible and need to have the same version. For this project, I am using the latest version of Unity ML Agents.

## Creating the project

Include ML Agents package in your project to get started and enable Barracuda in Unity.


## Models

The trained models are present in the TF folder. The models are pretty bad since they were trained for only about 20 minutes. I will be fine tuning hyperparamters, trying out RNN based models and training for a longer period. For now the agent seems to go towards to width of the screen and fails to dodge properly.
